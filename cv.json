The WSAW corresponds to the case n=0 via a supersymmetric integral representation. We choose the range of the interaction so that the upper-critical dimension of both models is d+epsilon. Our main result is that, for small epsilon and small coupling strength, the critical two-point function exhibits mean-field decay, confirming a prediction of Fisher, Ma, and Nickel. The proof makes use of a renormalisation group method of Bauerschmidt, Brydges, and Slade, as well as a cluster expansion. This is joint work with Martin Lohmann and Gordon Slade.",
